My __CSS framework__ powered by SASS and based on scalable and maintainable CSS approaches.

Inspired by:
* inuit.css -- https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css by [@csswizardry](https://github.com/csswizardry)
* Suit -- https://github.com/suitcss/suit by [@necolas](https://github.com/necolas)

This framework depends on [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). To install run:

    $ gem install sass

If you'd like to use the available build tools just run

```
cd css-framework
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt release
```
