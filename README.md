My __CSS framework__ powered by SASS and based on scalable and maintainable CSS approaches.

Inspired by:
* inuit.css -- https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css by [@csswizardry](https://github.com/csswizardry)
* Suit -- https://github.com/suitcss/suit by [@necolas](https://github.com/necolas)

This framework depends on [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). To install run:

    $ gem install sass

Use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) tasks to compile CSS.
